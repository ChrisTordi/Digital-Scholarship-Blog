<p>This week I've been learning/implementing how to set up local server and build up website empowered by Omeka using MAMP. As an administrator of "Omeka Testing", I've learned how to add plugins and themes from omeka.net. The reading I was assigned this week is pretty hard to follow, but from the Lynda tutorial and basics of adding plugins, I've gained some sense of the logistics and creating/adding plugins to my website and how the back-end role of web development is like (making sure that an input my user would reflect directly in data base and give out desirable output). For next week, I'm going to learn PHP and html basics, so that I could understand the plugin/configuration codes in a better way.</p>
