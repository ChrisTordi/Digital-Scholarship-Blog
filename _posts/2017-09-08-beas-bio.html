<p>Hi everyone, </p>
<p>My name is Bea Crow, and I'm excited to be a digital scholarship intern, dealing with the ethics of digital scholarship. I am a prospective art history and CAMS double major, so I am a little new to the more technological side of the projects, but I'm very excited to learn. </p>
