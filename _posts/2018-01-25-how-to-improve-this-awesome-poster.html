<p>Sarah and Celeste's team made a really awesome poster for a Digital Humanities project:</p>
<p><a href="https://blogs.carleton.edu/dsinternship/files/2018/01/Screen-Shot-2018-01-24-at-8.30.27-PM-17dmiua.png"><img class=" wp-image-110 aligncenter" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2018-01-24-at-8.30.27-PM-17dmiua-300x223.png" alt="" width="410" height="305" /></a></p>
<p>As informative and interesting as the poster is, I personally feel like there are also areas for improvement. To begin with, as someone with short attention span and a dislike of dense materials, this poster simply contains too many words! Navigating through the poster to sift important information requires a lot of effort. It would've been cleaner and more straight-forward if some paragraphs are shortened or presented in alternative manners, which brings me to my next point - the development timeline could've been represented by a line, with marks indicating progress. Similarly, the research questions and results could be possibly connected by elements of graphics with short explanations by the side.</p>
<p>From examining this poster and trying to identify potential areas for improvement, I have learnt that giving criticism gracefully is tied to making concrete, meaningful suggestions, without which criticism could face the danger of turning into useless rant.</p>
