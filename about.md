# Digital Scholarship at Carleton

**Digital Scholarship Intern** is a paid academic year term position jointly sponsored by the **[Career Center](https://apps.carleton.edu/career/)**, **[Academic Technology](https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/its/at/)**, **[the Humanities Center](https://apps.carleton.edu/humanities/)**, and **[the Library](https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/library/)**. We aim to hire **4 interns** each year.

This is an excellent opportunity for students interested in gaining professional skills and learning more about the growing field of **digital scholarship**. This includes skills in **web development, accessibility and inclusive design, digital ethics and privacy**, as well as **project management methods and technologies (especially helpful for comps)**. Interns will work collaboratively on meaningful individual and group tasks that contribute to digital scholarship work being done across campus. They will receive supervision and ongoing professional mentoring from librarians, faculty, and academic technologists related to their learning goals.
