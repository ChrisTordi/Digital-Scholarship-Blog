# Digital-Scholarship-Blog
## Chris Tordi, Stephanie Herbers, Chris Padilla, Alec Wang

This github repository contains a Jekyll static site for the digital scholarship 2018-2019 interns at Carleton College.
The digital scholarship interns are focused on developing skills in web development, accessibility and inclusive design, digital ethics and privacy by learning about the growing field of digital scholarship.


This repository was created as an exercise of implementing a Jekyll static site. It contains blog posts by the interns, including reflections about the work done over a term, thoughts about conferences the interns jointly attended, and biographies about each intern.

The benefits of static sites, like Jenkyll, include: no upkeep, no hidden information, and it can be run from Github. Even with these benefits, we are chosing to continue our blog on Wordpress. We found that working with multiple collaborators was more difficult with a static site.
